# Gedcom-RestoreHead

When you import a GEDCOM file into an application, and then export it,
it may alter HEADer items undesirably. For example, Family Tree Maker
ruins the SUMB record and provides no COPR record.

This application helps to restore these items by straight copying from
another GEDCOM file.
